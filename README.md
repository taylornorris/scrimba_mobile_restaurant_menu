    - Follow figma design ✅
    - Render 3 menu items using JavaScipt ✅
    - Be able to add/remove items ✅

### Stretch Goals 
    - Change the theme 
    - Offer a "meal deal" discount 
    - Allow users to rate their experience

Although I have not yet incorporated any of the stretch goals, I did add lots of functionality to the original design. 

    - There is a message asking for items to be added to start the order. When an item is added the order is shown. If all items are removed the order is hidden and the message is shown again.
    - Added order total to the pay button on the modal
    - Added close button to the modal if order needs to be edited
    - Changed screen after payment. Hides menu and shows order receipt.
    - Added various button effects.
